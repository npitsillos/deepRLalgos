# DeepRLAlgos
This repository contains deep reinforcement learning algorithm implementations.  It is an implementation that does not utilise mutliple processes but instead focusses on simplicity and transparency.  It is easy to follow the algorithm and understand it since it is not hidden away behind multiple abstractions.

The package expects an environment and a policy to be provided which offers more control to the user over the models.

# Supported Implementations
1. [Proximal Policy Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf)

# TODO
A list of supported algorithms to become available in the future in order of implementation.

1. [Soft Actor Critic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01290.pdf)
